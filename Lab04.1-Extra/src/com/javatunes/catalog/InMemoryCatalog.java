     * After you've satisfied your contractual obligations above, do these additional tasks.

     * NOTES:
     * 0. You can tackle them in any order, each one is independent of the others.
     *    They generally get harder as you go further down.
     *
     * 1. None of these methods should print to stdout (the console).  Instead, return a value.
     *    Each one should be tested by a test method in InMemoryCatalogTest,
     *    and there you *can* print your results, to verify that your code works correctly.
     *
     * 2. You may need to research a few things, that's to be expected.  Life Is Open-Book...
     *    The Javadoc is a good first place to look.
     *
     * 3. Keep a lookout for redundant code.  There is a high probability that you will write a chunk
     *    of code more than once.  When you see that, you should strongly consider refactoring that
     *    repeated code into a private method, and then calling that method from where it's needed.
     *    IntelliJ helps a lot here.  Select the repeated code in question, then
     *    right-click -> Refactor -> Extract Method.
     *    It's not just about removing redundancies - it will make the more complicated methods easier to write!
